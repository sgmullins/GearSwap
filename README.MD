Successes
This was my first medium sized nodeJS project. This project uses express and express-generator as the node frame work, EJS as the view engine template, bootstrap on the front end for the theme, Cloudinary for image storage and Map box for geo-location of the items for sale. User Auth is done with mongoose and passport. I feel like I gained a good amount of knowledge reguarding MVC layouts.

Challenges
The challenges were many as this was my first 'real' project. Learning my way around mongoDB atlas, writing schemas and saving the data was a tough spot at first. Learning how to send requests from the front to the back end also required a bit of time and lots of google searches.
