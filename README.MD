<h2>Successes</h2>
This was my first medium sized nodeJS project. This project uses express and express-generator as the node frame work, EJS as the view engine template, bootstrap on the front end for the theme, Cloudinary for image storage and Map box for geo-location of the items for sale. User Auth is done with mongoose and passport. I feel like I gained a good amount of knowledge reguarding MVC layouts.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
The challenges were many as this was my first 'real' project. Learning my way around mongoDB atlas, writing schemas and saving the data was a tough spot at first. Learning how to send requests from the front to the back end also required a bit of time and lots of google searches.
